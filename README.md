## Pre-presentation

- [x] Ensure macbook linux system can use external screen via HDMI
- [x] Ensure Dwarf network connection
- [ ] Check if Dwarf usb audio is usable
- [ ] Check high-dpi, with libreoffice presentation stuff
- [x] Prepare photo of the Dwarf front-faced with HMI screen on
- [x] Prepare photo of the Dwarf internals (or have unit open?)
- [ ] Prepare basic graph/node sketch of Dwarf/Linux (dns server) -> USB (network device) -> PC
- [ ] Prepare Dwarf pedalboard useful for initial demo purposes
- [ ] Prepare xrun/latency-spike demo with memset tool (stop RT/big services, run rt-tests, run memset)
- [ ] macbook setup of Dwarf kernel build, for live-demo push
- [ ] Calculate time estimates

TODO fit in there somewhere:
- when to switch from devboard to hw proto (after "booting up"?)
- "The versioning problem" as its single topic? (TBD)
- explain: restore, kernel, rootfs, plugins-dep
